game time unlimited
leg health too much
remove seraph projectile script
scarab main cannon ignore the falcons players
AA turret needs to be more deadly
hide leg waypoint for allies
Scarab needs to eventually get to the objective also
longer burst interval scarab main cannon
capture time of territories needs increasing (to a whole minute? and then 30 seconds recover)
scarab needs to be downed for longer: 30 seconds
territory lost announcement when tower is lost?
announcement when scarab leg is destroyed?
announce_a_under_attack - building is being damaged by scarab + blinking marker
health indication on legs (restore functionality or new implemeentation?) meter on the screen

replace scarab projectiles with covenant bomb explosions? that might be too overpowered

lower territory cap to 45
UNSC bombs for flak cannon 
fix the weird ghost movements
fix collision depth on projectiles
objective text shouldn't be showing for elites
fortified text showing on non fortify locations (red team?)
prevent entering seraph script
SOMETHING TO NOTIFY PLAYERS THAT THE SCARAB IS DOWNED





### MAP NOTES
despawning players/objects
players get stuck in spawning screen
ENCOURAGE PLAYERS TO GET ON SCARAB THROUGH TELEPORT
get rid of some of the falcons
accessibility for non-jetpack players (mainly on the main objective)
accessibility for jetpack players, ability to reach higher structures
spawns & brospawns need improving
covenant spawn room needs reorganizing to encourage infantry to board the scarab
more weapns to combat falcons
funnel players to objective?
potentially decrease lag? idk how
main building did not collapse correctly

### MODE NOTES
ANTI DISTRACT TIMER ON SCARAB 
fix AA turret regening health
fix getting into the seraph
give general elite sprint
big text on screen saying you cant destroy the core till the legs are done	 
betrayal booting off
destroyed leg counter, + tell players core is locked
brospawning prevents playes from inheriting new biped


### maybe do's
add turrets/weapons on the buildings (although that would attribute to the vehicle count)
force spawn players who aren't spawning
message to player to get to the territiory objectives - resupply zones?
message to players as to whether core is open or not


### OTHER NOTES

shotgun & sword classes were never ever used
encourage rooftop combat & on scarab combat
we should remove the grids that act as the walls





### TODO


### polish
shrink projectiles
hide monitors


### considerations
setup longer downed timer for 4th leg getting downed?
fix scarab leg explosions?

### NOTES:
negatives have been disabled, the negative leg rotation will wrap around and lose the correct rotation to reach the bomb,
however this helps keep the legs from inside of the scarab
